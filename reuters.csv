" U.S. President Barack Obama visited a refugee centre in Malaysia on Saturday to highlight his call for more compassion at home to deal with a global migrant crisis, as Republicans seek to block U.S. acceptance of Syrian refugees.
Speaking of the children he met at the Dignity for Children Foundation in Kuala Lumpur, Obama said ""that's the face of not only children from Myanmar, that's the face of Syrian children and Iraqi children"". 
Many of the children at the centre were Muslim Rohingyas who have fled persecution in Myanmar. 
Alluding to Republican critics who are trying to halt the flow of Syrian refugees to the United States, Obama said: “The notion that somehow we would be fearful of them, that our politics would somehow leave us to turn our sights away from their plight is not representative of the best of who we are.”
Obama’s visit to the refugee centre came a week after attacks by Islamic State militants in Paris renewed debate over his plan to bring more than 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States over the next year. 
U.S. lawmakers have called for Obama to pause or stop the program altogether, citing concerns it could lead to infiltration of militants who could launch Paris-style attacks.
""Apparently they're scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,"" Obama said on Wednesday in Manila, where he was attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
He insisted that the process for screening refugees for possible entry into the United States was rigorous and said the United States didn't make good decisions ""based on hysteria"" or exaggerated risk.
60 MILLION REFUGEES
Obama told reporters on Saturday that one of the reasons he came to visit the refugee centre in Kuala Lumpur was ""because globally we are seeing an unprecedented number of refugees"" and Washington needed to demonstrate leadership on the issue.
""The world is already focused on the humanitarian crisis taking place in Syria but we can't forget that there are millions of other refugees from war-torn parts of the world,” Obama said as he met with a small group of refugees at the centre.
Obama highlighted the case of a 16-year-old girl who sat smiling beside him. She fled Myanmar when she was eight and was being resettled in the United States, he said.
The U.N. refugee agency estimates that violence has displaced 60 million people across the world.
Malaysia, which is hosting 18 world leaders for a series of meetings this weekend, has taken in 153,880 refugees and asylum seekers as of September, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. About 90 percent of them are from Myanmar.
The Rohingya are a Muslim minority who have been denied citizenship in Myanmar and make up one of the largest groups of stateless people in the world. Militant Buddhists have targeted them in violence, helping to fuel their exodus from Myanmar.
They have been targeted in violent attacks by militant Buddhists.
The United Nations estimates that over 120,000 Rohingya have fled in the past three years, including an estimated 25,000 by boat this year. Thousands have been waylaid at sea and held for ransom by human traffickers.
In May, mass graves were exhumed at jungle camps on the border between Thailand and Malaysia that were thought to be mainly Rohingya victims of human traffickers.
Myanmar’s former junta and the quasi-civilian government that replaced it say the Rohingya are considered illegal migrants from Bangladesh -  even those that have been in the country for generations.

" Bangladesh executed two opposition leaders on Sunday for war crimes committed during the 1971 war to break away from Pakistan, a senior police official said, in a move likely to draw an angry reaction from supporters.
""Both of them were hanged simultaneously on two separate platforms,"" the police official said.
Islamist opposition leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, former legislator from former premier Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), were hanged shortly after President Abdul Hamid rejected their appeals late on Saturday for clemency. 
Mujahid, 67, of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, and Chowdhury, 66, were hanged at Dhaka Central Jail. The Supreme Court had previously rejected their appeals against a death sentence imposed by a special tribunal for genocide and torture of civilians during the conflict.
The Border Guard Bangladesh paramilitary force has been deployed across the country to tighten security.
Muslim-majority Bangladesh, until 1971 East Pakistan, has seen a rise in Islamist violence in recent months, with two foreigners and four secular writers and a publisher killed this year.
Mujahid was found guilty on five charges including torture and the murders of intellectuals and minority Hindus while he commanded Al Badr, an auxiliary force of the Pakistani army, during the war to break away from Pakistan.
Chowdhury, former legislator from former premier Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was convicted in October 2013 on charges of genocide, religious persecution, abduction and torture during the war.
""While we are saddened that we have lost our father by way of a motivated and predetermined trial and where the country is gagged from speaking out, we find hope in the fact that the international community recognizes the injustice and that fairness and truth shall be restored in Bangladesh,"" Humam Quader Chowdhury, a son of Chowdhury, told Reuters.
""We fought for them under the law and we have been defeated in the legal fight,"" defense councillor Khandker Mahbub Hossain told Reuters.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina opened an inquiry into crimes committed during the war in 2010, paving the way for prosecutions by a war crimes tribunal that Islamists have denounced as part of a politically motivated campaign aimed at weakening Jamaat-e-Islami's leadership.
Two Jamaat leaders have been executed, one in December 2013 and another in April. They declined to seek clemency from the president. 
BNP spokesman Asaduzzaman Ripon said: ”Salauddin has fallen victim to persecution because of his political identity, and he has been denied justice.” 
Moqbul Ahmed, acting Amir of Jamaat, said in a statement that Mujahid was a victim of government conspiracy. He called a day long general strike on Monday across the country.
The government denies accusations of interference in the judiciary.
East Pakistan broke away to become independent Bangladesh after a war between India and Pakistan. About three million people were killed.

"The decision was taken despite mounting calls to cooperate more closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the fight against Islamic State following the militant group's Nov. 13 attacks in Paris which killed 130 people.
U.S. President Barack Obama, Germany's Angela Merkel, Britain's David Cameron, Italy's Matteo Renzi and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who represented President Francois Hollande at the summit, attended the brief meeting near the conclusion of the G20 meeting in Antalya.
The sanctions are due to expire in January, before full implementation of the so-called Minsk peace deal, which aims to resolve the standoff between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Western countries have said all elements of Minsk need to be fulfilled before they can consider easing the sanctions.
In particular, the diplomat said, the leaders had concluded that it was important to maintain pressure on Russia ahead of planned elections in eastern Ukraine.
""The elections in Ukraine are heavy lifting,"" the diplomat said, requesting anonymity because the agreement in Antalya was confidential.
""We only have a chance to get what we want if we play the sanctions card. Financial sanctions need to stay in place until the bitter end,"" the diplomat added.
Following the attacks, Hollande has called for a grand coalition of nations to fight Islamic State, which controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The French president is due to travel to Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss closer cooperation with Putin.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will dine with Hollande in Paris the evening before his trip and, according to German officials, will urge him to remain firm on the sanctions question while in Moscow.

" The Vatican on Saturday ordered five people, including two Italian journalists, to stand trial for leaking and publishing secret documents, in the latest development in a leaks scandal which is rocking the papacy.
The trial stems from the publication of two recent books which depict a Vatican plagued by mismanagement, greed and corruption and where Pope Francis faces stiff resistance from the old guard to his reform agenda. 
The Holy See was embarrassed and angered by the books, which it said used information that should never have been allowed to leave the walls of the city state.
Prosecutors said three Vatican officials, including a high-ranking priest, formed ""an organized criminal association"" with the aim of ""divulging information and documents concerning the fundamental interests of the Holy See and the State"".
The first hearing in the trial will begin on Tuesday at 0930 GMT, the president of the Vatican court ordered.
The leaks are one of the biggest internal scandals to hit the papacy of Pope Francis and are reminiscent of the ""Vatileaks"" furor that preceded the resignation of former Pope Benedict in 2013. The Italian media has dubbed the latest episodes ""Vatileaks II"".
Two of the officials indicted, Spanish Monsignor Angel Lucio Vallejo Balda, who was number two at the Vatican's Prefecture for Economic Affairs, and Italian laywoman Francesca Chaouqui, a public relations expert, were arrested earlier this month.
Both were members of a commission Francis set up in 2013 to study economic and administrative reforms. The third official, Nicola Maio, was an assistant to Vallejo Balda.
The two journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi, wrote books based on the leaks. They both ""solicited and applied pressure, especially on Vallejo Balda, to obtain secret documents and information,"" the court order said.
The books, ""Merchants in the Temple"" by Nuzzi and ""Avarice"" by Fittipaldi, were published this month. 
The Vatican has said the books give a ""partial and tendentious"" version of events and has condemned the writers for trying to reap financial advantages from receiving stolen documents. Both authors have rejected the accusations, saying they were just doing their jobs.
Nuzzi told Reuters on Saturday he had ""never applied pressure on anyone"" and would discuss with his lawyers whether or not to attend Tuesday's hearing. He said his lawyers had told him he risked 4-8 years' imprisonment.
""The Italian constitution guarantees the right to information and expression but the Vatican is a state with no right to information,"" he said.
""If they think they can silence me they are following the wrong path, because after me other reporters will tell the facts and the information will not stop.""

" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he wanted global cooperation to combat terrorism after Islamist militants killed 19 people, including six Russians, in an attack on a luxury hotel in Mali 
Friday's assault came a week after militants killed 130 people in gun and bomb attacks in Paris claimed by Islamic State, and three weeks after a Russian airliner was downed over Egypt by what Moscow and Western governments say was a bomb, killing all 224 people aboard.
The bloodshed at the Radisson Blu hotel in Mali, a former French colony, evoked the problems French troops and U.N. peacekeepers face in restoring security and order in a West African state that has battled rebels and militants in its weakly-governed desert north for years.
Jihadist groups Al Mourabitoun and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for the attack, which ended when Malian commandos stormed the building and rescued 170 people, many of them foreigners.
President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said two militants were killed in the commando operation.
His government increased security at strategic points around Bamako at the start of a declared 10-day state of emergency.
""Mali will not shut down because of this attack. Paris and New York were not shut down and Mali won't be. Terrorism will not win,"" Keita said during a visit to the hotel on Saturday.
Six employees of Russian regional airline Volga-Dnepr were killed, Russia's foreign ministry said, while six others were rescued.
Putin sent a telegram of condolences to Keita and said ""the widest international cooperation"" was needed to confront global terrorism, according to a statement by the Kremlin.
On Tuesday, Putin pledged to hunt down militants responsible for blowing up the airliner, as well as intensified air strikes against militants in Syria, after the Kremlin concluded a bomb had destroyed the plane.
Putin and French President Francois Hollande also spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to boost coordination of their military actions in fighting jihadist militants in Syria.
Chinese President Xi Jinping condemned the ""cruel and savage"" attack, whose dead included three Chinese executives of a state-run railway firm.
""China will strengthen cooperation with the international community, resolutely crack down on violent terrorist operations that devastate innocent lives and safeguard world peace and security,"" the Beijing Foreign Ministry quoted Xi as saying in a statement on its website.
American public health specialist Anita Datar was killed and Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said two Belgians died. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he was not aware of any French nationals killed.
An Israeli national was also killed, Israeli media said. There was no confirmation from the foreign ministry.
FLEEING IN TERROR
The attack began at 7 a.m. on Friday when gunmen killed guards at the entrance of the hotel and barged inside.
Malian commandos subsequently stormed the hotel and rescued around 170 people, many of whom had been hiding under beds or in side-rooms and rushed terrified from the building to safety as shooting continued inside.
By around 4 p.m. the hotel was secured but Malians woke on Saturday to a sense of shock at the latest high-profile raid by Islamists this year.
""I feel bruised by this atrocious act, which cannot be justified. No nation, no human life deserves such criminal barbarity,"" said Oumar Fomba, a teacher. ""I urge the Malian government to fight more fiercely against terrorism.""
In a speech on the sidelines of a summit with Asian nations in Malaysia, U.S. President Barack Obama described the raid as ""another awful reminder of the scourge of terrorism"".
""This barbarity only stiffens our resolve ... We will stand with the people of Mali as they work to rid their country of terrorists and strengthen their democracy,"" he said.
SETBACK FOR FRANCE
The attack was another jolting setback for France, which has stationed 3,500 troops in northern Mali to try to restore stability after a rebellion in 2012 by ethnic Tuaregs that was later hijacked by jihadists linked to al Qaeda.
""We (France) have proved to be as blind as the Malian elite. Nothing changes in Mali. The elite continues to act like it always has, as does the international community,"" said Laurent Bigot, former undersecretary in charge of West Africa at France's foreign ministry, alluding to U.N. peacekeepers.
""People have been ringing the alarm bell for a long time, but it doesn't do any good,"" Bigot, who now works as a consultant, told Reuters.
The attack also refocused attention on a veteran leader of Al Mourabitoun, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, after reports, never confirmed, that he was killed in an air strike in June.
Northern Mali was occupied by Islamist fighters, some with links to al Qaeda, for most of 2012. They were driven out by a French-led military operation, but violence has continued.
Al Mourabitoun has claimed responsibility for attacks including an assault on a hotel in the town of Sevare, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Bamako, in August in which 17 people including five U.N. staff were killed.
A preliminary investigation showed similarities between the Sevare and Bamako hotel attacks, a senior U.N. official said.
Belmokhtar is blamed for an assault on an Algerian gas field in 2013 and linked with insurgencies across North Africa.

" A heavy fall snowstorm hit the Midwestern United States on Saturday, blanketing states from South Dakota to Wisconsin with as much as 16 inches (40 cm) of snow, slowing air travel and delaying some events for U.S. presidential candidates.
The storm was forecast to travel east into the Great Lakes region, reaching Michigan and upstate New York according to the National Weather Service. It forecast widespread accumulations of 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) of snow.
Forecasters warned that trees that had not already dropped their leaves could be damaged by the heavy, wet snow.
""We have snow across the area with heavier amounts across northern Illinois,"" said Amy Seeley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Chicago.
While it is uncommon for the Midwest to see such heavy snowfall so early in the year, the storm is not unprecedented, Seeley said, noting that an early November storm in 1951 dropped 9.3 inches of snow over the area.
""This has happened before, but obviously it's not as common to have this much snow in November,"" she said.
In Chicago, Brian Love, 50, headed out anyway, stopping at a local pharmacy before making a library run.
""This is good weather to push my bike in,"" Love said. ""The only thing you can do is walk it because it's too slushy and too deep to actually ride.""
Robert Schneck, 52, a worker for the maintenance division of suburban Park Forest, Illinois, had been called out for an unusual Saturday shift because of the storm.
""It couldn't be light and fluffy. It had to be heavy and wet,"" he said. ""Gotta clear a path for people to walk.""
The storm also caused several Republican presidential candidates to cancel events in Iowa, home of the critical first nominating caucus. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, cut some events from their schedules while U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas canceled plans to visit the state.
Snow was forecast to continue into the early evening hours, with single-digit Fahrenheit temperatures hitting parts of the northern Midwest overnight, she said.
The storm affected air travel, with 514 U.S. flights canceled by Saturday morning, with Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway International airports the hardest hit. One in three Midway departures had been canceled by 9:30 a.m. (1530 GMT).
The Illinois and Michigan Departments of Transportation warned that snow and ice-covered roads would require slow travel.

" There is a ""strong case"" for raising interest rates when Federal Reserve policymakers meet next month, as long as U.S. economic data does not disappoint, a top Fed official said on Saturday. 
""The data I think have been overall encouraging, especially on the labor market,"" San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters after a conference at University of California Berkeley's Clausen Center. 
""Assuming that we continue to get good data on the economy, continue to get signs that we are moving closer to achieving our goals and gaining confidence getting back to 2-percent inflation... If that continues to happen there's a strong case to be made in December to raise rates."" 
The Fed is widely seen increasing its benchmark overnight interest rate at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting, and the debate  is already shifting to the pace of rate hikes going forward.
Williams sought on Saturday to make clear that rate hikes would not only be gradual, but would not follow the stair-step pattern that characterized the Fed's last policy-tightening cycle, when it raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point at every meeting. 
""I do think the slope is the most important thing to communicate, the pace of increases,"" he said, adding that the Fed's quarterly economic forecasts will be critical in that regard, along with public comments from Fed officials and possible changes to the Fed's post-meeting statement. 
""We definitely do not want to, either through our actions or our words, indicate a preference for a very mechanical path of interest rates, whether it’s every other meeting or however you think about it,"" Williams said. ""Since economic data can surprise on the upside and the downside, maybe there will be opportunities to show we are data dependent.""

" Honduran police arrested a Syrian woman and two Pakistani men on Saturday after determining they were traveling illegally and presumably en route to the United States, authorities said.
The woman had a photocopy of a Syrian passport and the two men described themselves as Pakistani but did not carry passports, police commissioner Leonel Sauceda clarified to Reuters. None entered through an official border crossing, Sauceda said earlier.
""They entered at a blind spot,"" he said.
The three were detained on a public bus in the Central American country's southern Choluteca state, at a highway checkpoint after having entered Honduras from Nicaragua.
Another police official who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to talk about the case said nearly all migrants detained in the area are traveling en route to the United States.   
The Honduran police have identified the Syrian woman as 39-year-old Hanna Maissoun. The two Pakistanis are Muhammad Shafiq, 30, and Nassem Abbas, 21, the police said.
It was not immediately clear how long they have been in the region.
Earlier this week, Honduran authorities detained five Syrian nationals traveling on doctored Greek passports.
The five men had been fleeing conflict in Syria and had been trying to get to the United States when they were stopped, the authorities said.
Honduran police said there were no signs of any links to the Nov. 13 suicide bombings and shootings in Paris that killed 130 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.
The five were part of a wider group of seven Syrian nationals who acquired forged passports in Brazil and then went by land to Argentina on their way north, a U.S. government source familiar with the case said. The source also said there was no evidence to suggest the men were militants.
(This version of the story has been officially corrected to show that the police corrected the passport status of detained people in the second paragraph.)

" French police have released seven of the eight people rounded up when they raided a flat last Wednesday where the suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks was hiding, a judicial source said.
Islamic State jihadist Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, one of the group's most high-profile European recruits, died during the police assault along with a woman believed to be his cousin and a third person yet to be identified.
During the raid, police took in eight people for questioning, five from inside the building in the northern St. Denis suburb and three from outside, including a man who said he was in charge of the property and is still being held.
A source close to the investigation said the five from inside who have been freed were believed just to be squatters without proper identity papers, while a man and a woman picked up outside have also been released.
France has launched a massive investigation to get to the bottom of exactly who was behind the massacres that killed 130 people in Paris last Friday and stunned a nation still raw from militant attacks in the capital in January.
Investigators believe Abaaoud, a Moroccan-born Belgian who had fought for Islamic State in Syria, was the mastermind behind the shootings and bombings at the national soccer stadium, a famous concert venue and several bars and restaurants.
European governments thought he was still in Syria until a tip-off from Morocco that he was in France at the time of the attacks, the worst in the country since World War II.
Abaaoud was caught on camera in the east of Paris after the initial wave of shootings, heading into a metro station not far from an abandoned black Seat Leon which had three AK47 assault rifles, five full ammunition clips and 11 empty clips inside.
Two sources involved in the investigation said on Saturday his fingerprints were on one of the weapons but it was not clear whether he took part in the shootings, or had just handled the rifle. The fingerprints of Brahim Abdeslam, who blew himself up after attacking a cafe, were on another of the AK47s. 
CURFEW
Police tracked Abaaoud to the apartment in St. Denis by following Hasna Aitboulahcen, a woman who may have been his cousin and whose phone was being tapped as part of a drugs investigation.
Officials reported that she had blown herself up during the raid, but a source close to the investigation said on Friday that someone else in the flat had used the explosive vest.
French media reported on Saturday that Aitboulahcen may not even have been involved in the plot, only being asked by Abaaoud to find a hideout as a last resort.
Investigators are still trying to identify the remains of the third person in the flat, as well as two men who came through Greece in October and blew themselves up outside the stadium while the French soccer team was playing Germany.
Police across Europe are also hunting Salah Abdeslam who made it to Belgium from France in a VW Golf the day after the attacks, despite being stopped by French police along the way.
In response to the Paris attacks, French police have carried out nightly raids across the country.
Local authorities in Sens, about 130 km southeast of Paris, imposed a curfew on Friday from 10 p.m. (2100 GMT) to 6 a.m. in one part of the town - the first curfew in France since a state of emergency was announced the day after the attacks.
The curfew for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights came after police found weapons and fake identity cards during raids in the area and other parts of the Yonne department.
A ban on demonstrations in the Paris region under the state of emergency was also extended on Saturday until Nov. 30.    
An opinion poll on Saturday showed that President Francois Hollande, the most unpopular French leader since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, got an eight-point popularity boost after the attacks.
Thirty-three percent of those polled said they had a favorable opinion of Hollande, his highest rating since Jan. 14, a week after attacks on a satirical magazine and a kosher supermarket cost 17 lives.

" Belgium put the capital Brussels on maximum security alert on Saturday, shutting the metro and warning people to avoid crowds because of a ""serious and imminent"" threat of coordinated, multiple attacks by militants.
A week after
Paris bombings and shootings carried out by Islamic State militants, of whom one suspect from Brussels is at large, Brussels was placed on the top level ""four"" in the government's threat scale after a meeting of police, justice and intelligence officials.
Soldiers were on guard in parts of Brussels, a city of 1.2 million people and home to institutions of the European Union and the headquarters of NATO.
""The result of relatively precise information pointed to the risk of an attack along the lines of what took take place in Paris,"" Prime Minister Charles Michel told a news conference on Saturday after a meeting of the national security council. The Paris attacks left 130 people dead.
""We are talking about the threat that several individuals with arms and explosives would launch an attack perhaps in several locations at the same time,"" Michel said, adding people should be alert but not panic.
He declined to elaborate, but said the government would review the situation on Sunday afternoon. 
The metro system is to remain closed until then, in line with recommendation of the government's crisis center. Major shopping centers and stores did open on Saturday morning, with soldiers deployed outside shops. 
However, many began closing their doors from around midday.
The crisis center advised the public to avoid places with crowds, such as shopping centers, concerts, sports events or public transport hubs. 
The city's museums and many cinemas and sports centers were shut, on separate orders from the city's 19 different local mayors. Clubs and venues canceled events, including a planned concert of veteran French rock singer Johnny Hallyday.
The agency has called on local authorities to postpone soccer matches, although most games in the top two divisions were set to go ahead.
Brussels-based Anderlecht's visit to Lokeren was canceled because the fixture was identified as a risk match requiring federal police, who were no longer available even with an increased military presence.
Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said that 1,000 troops were now available for patrols, double the level of a week earlier.
Stranded tourists on the cold and damp streets appeared more bemused than fearful, including Dutchman Gerrit Valkeman on a weekend trip with his wife.
""We had planned to visit museums, but are a bit puzzled about what to do now,"" he said at Place Royale, a square surrounded by museums and galleries.
Tour guide Stephane Bruno was planning to take a group of Americans around the city, but they canceled on advice from the U.S. embassy.
""My wife said not to go out today. But we were invaded by Napoleon and Louis XIV and were occupied eight times. We won't be defeated this time by terrorists,"" he said.
On normally bustling central shopping street Rue Neuve, Sofia Kostarako, a Greek national living in Brussels, said she had come out to show her sister Ioanna around.
""We will have a walk anyway. You can't change everything about your life. If something bad is to happen to you - it will,"" she said.
BELGIUM AT HEART OF PARIS ATTACK PROBE
Belgium has been at the heart of investigations into the Paris attacks - which included suicide bombers targeting a France-Germany soccer match - after the links to Brussels, and the poor district of Molenbeek in particular, emerged.
Fugitive suspected militant Salah Abdeslam, 26, slipped back home to Brussels from Paris shortly after the attacks, in which his elder brother Brahim blew himself up at a cafe. Fears of the risks he still poses prompted the cancellation last week of an international friendly soccer match in Brussels against Spain. 
A second man from Molenbeek, Bilal Hadfi, was also among the Paris suicide bombers.
Three people detained in Brussels are now facing terrorism charges. Federal prosecutors said on Saturday that weapons had been found at the home of a person charged on Friday.
 Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon told reporters he wanted a register of everyone living in Molenbeek because it was not clear at present who was at each address, a process local officials had already started.
EU interior and justice ministers in Brussels on Friday pledged solidarity with France and agreed a series of new measures on surveillance, border checks and gun control.
French authorities have said the attacks were planned in Brussels by a local man, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, who fought for Islamic State in Syria and was killed in a police siege of an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis on Wednesday.
Abaaoud's fingerprints were found on one of three AK47 assault rifles in a car left in eastern Paris, a source close to the investigation said, though it was not clear if he took part in the attacks or had just handled the weapon at some point.
The last time any part of Belgium was put on maximum alert was in May 2014 when an Islamist gunman shot dead four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. At that time, Jewish schools, synagogues and other institutions were put on level four. 
The capital as a whole was last at the level four for about a month at the end of 2007 and the start of 2008, when authorities intercepted a plot to free convicted Tunisian Nizar Trabelsi. Brussels' New Year fireworks display was canceled.
Trabelsi was sentenced in Belgium in 2003 to 10 years for attempting to blow up a Belgian military base that houses U.S. soldiers. He was extradited to the United States in 2013.
Turkish police arrested a Belgian man of Moroccan origin on suspicion of having scouted out the Paris target sites. 
A ban on demonstrations in the Paris area was extended on Saturday until Nov. 30, while a night curfew was imposed in parts of Sens, a town southeast of Paris, after raids there.
