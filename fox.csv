"Americans in Belgium were ordered “to shelter in place” Saturday after local authorities warned that the threat of a terrorist attack in the country’s capital is serious and imminent.
The U.S. Embassy in Brussels also ordered American citizens to remain at home as the city was placed on lockdown in response to the terrorist threat. The national crisis center raised its terrorism alert Saturday to its highest level as Belgian police continued to search for a suspect in the Paris attacks that killed 130 people.
In a statement on its website Saturday the embassy informed Americans that “if you must go out, avoid large crowds.”
The warning also urged U.S. citizens to “exercise caution in public transportation systems, sporting events, residential areas, business offices, shopping malls and other tourist destinations.”
Belgian leaders raised the terrorism alert to Level 4, which indicates a “serious and immediate threat.” 
Prime Minister Charles Michel said the decision to raise the alert level was taken ""based on quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in Paris...where several individuals with arms and explosives launch actions, perhaps even in several places at the same time.""
Authorities across Europe, the Middle East and Washington are trying to determine how a network of French and Belgian nationalists with links to Islamic extremists in Syria plotted and carried out the deadliest violence in France since World War II – and how many may still be on the loose.
Brussels was home to the suspected organizer of the Nov. 13 terror attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, and Belgium has filed charges of “participation in terrorist attacks and participation in the activities of a terrorist organization” against three suspects relating to the Paris attacks.
Heavily armed police and soldiers patrolled key intersections of the Belgian capital Saturday morning, a city of more than 1 million that is home to the headquarters of the European Union, the NATO alliance and officers of many multinational corporations. Residents were recommended to avoid gatherings, train stations, airports and commercial districts. Service was halted on the Brussels Metro, as well as on streetcar lines that run underground, and residents were urged to stay indoors.
A new potential link emerged Saturday in Turkey, where authorities detained a suspected ISIS militant from Belgium who was believed in contact with the Paris attackers.
Ahmet Dahmani, 26, a Belgian of Moroccan descent, was detained with two other suspected ISIS militants. A senior Turkish government official told the Associated Press Dahmani was believed to have been in contact with the Paris attackers but the official did not say when. Dahmani arrived in Turkey Nov. 14 from Amsterdam and the three were preparing to cross into Syria, the official said.
Parisians across the French capital honored the 130 victims Friday night with candles and dancing, marking one week since attackers opened fire on sidewalk cafes and exploded suicide vests at the national stadium and an iconic rock venue.
Prosecutors said Friday that they had determined through fingerprint checks that two of the seven attackers who died in the bloodshed Nov. 13 had entered Europe through Greece, an entry point for many of the hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking asylum in Europe.
The five other attackers who died had links to France and Belgium. One of the seven dead has not been identified, while a manhunt is underway for one suspect who escaped, Salah Abdeslam, 26. French police stopped Abdeslam the morning after Friday's attacks at the Belgian border but then let him go.
French officials said Saturday they could not ascertain for certain whether Abdeslam might be in France or Belgium. His brother Brahim, blew himself up in the Paris attacks.
The suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was killed in a raid early Wednesday on an apartment in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, along with Hasna Aitboulahcen, a 26-year-old woman who officials said had described herself as Abaaoud's cousin. Prosecutors said Friday that a third person was killed in the raid but did not release the identity.
They also said Aitboulahcen had not blown herself up with a suicide vest, as it was initially believed, which suggests the body parts collected in the rubble after Wednesday’s anti-terror raid belonged to a third person who has yet to be identified.
Marking a week since the carnage, some Parisians lit candles and paid tribute to the victims with silent reflection. Others decided that enjoying themselves was the best way to defy the extremists. They sang and danced on Place de la Republique, in the heart of a trendy neighborhood where scores of people were killed, most of them in the attack on the Bataclan concert hall.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/21/belgium-raises-terror-alert-to-highest-level-in-brussels/,US embassy warns Americans to stay home as Belgium raises terror alert to highest level
"Japan attacked the U.S. twice in the year after Pearl Harbor, pictured here.
Japan conducted a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941 that ultimately brought the United States into World War II.
What most people don’t know is that Japan conducted two surprise attacks on the U.S. mainland less than a year later, with the goal of starting wildfires. Now known as the Lookout Air Raids, beginning on Sep. 9, 1942, a Japanese submarine surfaced off the coast of Oregon, assembled a seaplane, and pilot Nobuo Fujita took off toward the Oregon forests.
Here’s what happened next, 
 to the Los Angeles Times:
At 6:24 a.m. Mr. Howard Gardner, a forestry service observer on Mt. Emily reported seeing an unidentified seaplane come from the west, circle and return toward the sea. He described the plane as a single-motored biplane with a single float and small floats on the wing tips. The plane appeared to be small and of slow speed. It had no lights, no distinct color and no insignia was visible. It is possible that a plane of this type might have been carried on a submarine.
Fortunately, it wasn’t the best time to start a fire since the area was so damp. While Fujita did successfully drop 
, it didn’t turn into the hoped-for wildfires that would take valuable resources away from the war effort.
Three weeks later, Fujita gave it another try with two more bombs, and once again, he was unsuccessful.
In his obituary in 1997, The New York Times 
:
A quiet, humble man who in his later years was deeply ashamed of his air raids on the United States, Mr. Fujita eventually forged a remarkable bond of friendship with the people of Brookings, the small logging town whose surrounding forests he had bombed. Last week, as he lay dying, the town council of Brookings hailed Mr. Fujita an ”ambassador of good will” and proclaimed him an ”honorary citizen” of the town.
His mission was unsuccessful but he was hailed as a hero back in Japan. And Fujita did earn his place in history as the pilot flying the only enemy aircraft that has ever bombed the U.S. mainland.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/11/19/japan-bombed-us-mainland-during-world-war-ii-hoping-to-start-forest-fire/,Japan bombed the US mainland during World War II hoping to start a forest fire
"Two high-ranking officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs were demoted Friday in response to allegations that they manipulated the agency's hiring system for their own gain.
The VA said in a statement that Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves were demoted from senior executives — the highest rank for career employees — to general workers within the Veterans Benefits Administration.
Rubens was director of the Philadelphia regional office for the VBA, while Graves led the St. Paul, Minnesota, regional office.
The VA's acting inspector general said in a report this fall that Rubens and Graves forced lower-ranking regional managers to accept job transfers against their will. Rubens and Graves then stepped into the vacant positions themselves, keeping their pay while reducing their responsibilities.
Rubens and Graves refused to testify to Congress earlier this month, telling lawmakers they were asserting their Fifth Amendment rights to protect themselves against self-incrimination.
Before taking the regional jobs, Rubens was a deputy undersecretary at the VA's Washington headquarters, while Graves was director of VBA's 14-state North Atlantic Region.
Rubens and Graves kept their salaries of $181,497 and $173,949, respectively, in their new positions, even though they had less responsibility and a lower pay range than their previous positions.
Rubens grew up near Philadelphia, while Graves has family in Minnesota, the IG's report said.
In addition to naming themselves to vacancies, Rubens and Graves obtained more than $400,000 in questionable moving expenses through a relocation program for VA executives, the IG's report said. The two face possible criminal prosecution.
The relocation program has since been suspended, the VA said in congressional testimony this month.
Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said Rubens and Graves ""clearly should have been fired,"" adding that, ""for those wondering whether VA is committed to real accountability for corrupt employees, VA leaders answered that question (Friday) with a resounding 'no.'""
The VA's failure to fire Rubens and Graves ""gives me no hope the department will do the right thing and take steps to recover the more than $400,000 in taxpayer dollars Rubens and Graves fraudulently obtained,"" Miller said. ""The millions of American veterans who depend on VA and the hundreds of thousands of VA employees who are dedicated professionals deserve better than this broken status quo.""
Dale Barnett, national commander of the American Legion, said the VA's failure to fire Rubens and Graves was ""an insult and a disgrace to all veterans. Any promises that VA officials make about accountability in the future need to be taken with a grain of salt.""
Allison Hickey, the former head of the Veterans Benefits Administration, resigned in October amid criticism of a backlog in disability claims and questions about her role in the transfers obtained by Rubens and Graves. The IG's report said Hickey and other top VA officials may have encouraged the scheme.
Two representatives for the VA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Leaders of Southeast Asia will formally declare their diverse region is now an economic community that in some ways resembles the European Union, but they have a long way to go before the project becomes fully functional. The declaration will be made at a weekend summit that will also focus on the long-seething maritime rifts in the South China Sea and terrorism.
The 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, will also hold talks with their counterparts from eight other countries, including President Barack Obama. A look at the key topics in the meetings:
ASEAN COMMUNITY
ASEAN leaders will on Sunday formally launch the ASEAN Community that has been 10 years in the making, encompassing three key pillars: economic, political-security and socio-cultural. It will become a formal entity on Dec. 31.
The transformation of the disparate region into a unified market forms the core of the community. The ASEAN Economic Community, or the AEC as it is known, is aimed at bolstering the region's economic clout and counterbalance a rising China and an America that is increasingly assertive in Asia. It goes beyond liberalizing trade in goods. Services, investment, skilled labor and capital will also be allowed to move across borders more freely, a landmark step in economic cooperation for the region.
In one key development, easing restrictions on work visas will make it easier for people from one country to seek employment in another, but so far it applies only to eight professions, including medical, accounting, engineering and tourism.
WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY?
Its members are the 10 ASEAN countries with a total population of more than 600 million people, larger than either the European Union or North America. ASEAN was set up in 1967 as a bulwark against communism in the Cold War era but it was only in the last two decades that attention shifted to economic integration. A wide economic gulf divides Southeast Asia's rich and middle income economies — Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines — and its four less developed members, communist Vietnam and Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
FUNDAMENTALS
Unlike the European Union, the 10 members will maintain their economic and financial independence. There will be no central agencies such as a common central bank, parliament or court as in Europe, and no common currency. The AEC is based more on consensus than creating overarching institutions that take on some of the powers of member governments.
Changes will not be abrupt because many of the targets have been implemented gradually over the last five years. While tariff on most goods traded in the region have been largely eliminated, ASEAN still falls short on more politically sensitive areas of reform such as opening up protected sectors like agriculture, steel and motor vehicles. Intra-regional trade has remained at around 24 percent for the last decade, far lower than 60 percent in the EU.
CHALLENGES
The Asian Development Bank in a research paper earlier this year warned that creating a fully functional economic community by Dec. 31 is impossible. Southeast Asian officials however, stress that the formation of the AEC is not the destination but a journey to deeper integration. They say more work is required on domestic reforms, infrastructure and strengthening skills. Efforts must also be made to address trade and investment impediments, non-tariff barriers and other regulatory hindrances that are increasingly replacing tariffs as protective measures for some industries. At the same time, government corruption and unreliable courts in the region also create roadblocks to trade because they make contracts hard to enforce.
SOUTH CHINA SEA
The maritime conflict in one of the world's busiest waterways has long been a sore point in the region. China claims most of the South China Sea, creating a fault-line in relations with its regional neighbors. Taiwan and ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam also have overlapping claims across the sea. The Philippines and Vietnam in particular have been at odds with China over the region in recent years, with diplomatic squabbles erupting over oil and gas exploration and fishing rights.
Through land reclamation, China has created artificial islands from reefs to bolster its claims. Earlier this week, Obama renewed calls for China to halt land reclamation, construction and militarization in the disputed area, and is expected to repeat the same message at the Kuala Lumpur meetings.
FIGHT AGAINST TERROR
ASEAN and its partners are expected to increase commitment and cooperation in the war against terrorism following last Friday's deadly attacks by the Islamic State extremist group in Paris, which killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds.
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Zahid Hamidi this week voiced concerns that the simultaneous bombings at a stadium, concert hall and cafes in Paris could spark copycats in the region. Security measures have been enhanced for the regional summits in Kuala Lumpur, with checks stepped up at all entry and exit points to the country. Some 10,000 police and army personnel have been deployed at the meeting venue, hotels and other strategic locations in the city. The U.S., China and Russia have been given permission to bring their own armed security teams.
REAL THREAT
Zahid said a leaked police circular outlined the presence of a regional terrorist network, Daulah Nusantara, that aims to take over Southeast Asia. It involves two Philippines Muslim rebel groups and the Islamic State.
Zahid, who is also home minister, said Malaysian authorities have detected their plans earlier and taken action to prevent the group from carrying out any attacks. Police in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and several other countries are working together to thwart the group, he added.
National Police Chief Khalid Abu Bakar said in a statement late Thursday that reports of imminent terrorist threats in Malaysia have yet to be confirmed but security forces are taking all possible precautions.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/19/formation-economic-union-sea-row-and-terrorism-top-agenda-southeast-asian/,"Formation of economic union, sea row and terrorism top agenda of Southeast Asian summit"
"France called Friday on its European Union partners to take immediate and decisive action to toughen the bloc's borders and prevent the entry of more violent extremists.
""We can't take more time. This is urgent,"" Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
One week after the coordinated attacks claimed by Islamic State that killed 129 people in Paris, Cazeneuve and the other EU interior and justice ministers opened an emergency meeting on the next steps to take to prevent more bloodshed. France and Belgium were expected to urge their EU partners to tighten gun laws, toughen border security and choke off funds to extremist groups.
""Terrorists are crossing the borders of the European Union,"" said Cazeneuve, underlining why the 28-nation bloc must move forward on a long-delayed system for collecting and exchanging airline passenger information. That system would allow the EU to better track extremists and foreign fighters coming and going from Syria and Iraq, he said.
Britain's interior minister, Theresa May, said the EU must quickly implement beefed-up border security measures already agreed on, saying there was a clear link between tightened borders and the safety of Europeans.
Ministers, however, were not expected to order any new measures that could be immediately introduced. Documents prepared for the meeting and seen by The Associated Press indicate the ministers instead will try to push forward on priorities already identified, but not acted on, by EU leaders following an earlier round of lethal attacks in Paris on a satirical newspaper and a kosher grocery in January.
The narrative provided by French officials on the brazen and carefully coordinated attacks a week ago on France's national stadium and Paris cafes, restaurants and a theater raises disturbing questions about how a wanted militant already suspected of involvement in multiple plots could slip into Europe undetected.
French investigators quickly identified Belgian-born Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, as the architect of the attacks in Paris, but believed he had coordinated the assaults against a soccer stadium, cafes and a rock concert from the battlefields of Syria.
That situation changed drastically on Monday when France received a tip from a non-European country that Abaaoud had slipped back into Europe through Greece, Cazeneuve said Thursday.
""It was a big surprise when the intelligence came in,"" one French police official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because the information was sensitive. ""There were many people who didn't take it seriously, but effectively it was confirmed.""
How and when Abaaoud entered France before his death remained unclear. He had bragged in the Islamic State group's English-language magazine that he was able to move in and out of Europe undetected.
As it turned out, not only was Abaaoud in Europe, but right under the noses of French investigators, a 15-minute walk from the Stade de France stadium where three suicide bombers blew themselves up during the Nov. 13 attacks that also wounded hundreds.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Abaaoud was traced to the apartment in Saint-Denis through phone taps and surveillance. Following a lengthy police assault, the suspected plot ringleader and his cousin both died in a hail of bullets and explosions.
The Paris prosecutor's office says that a third body — of an unidentified woman — was found overnight in the apartment.
The whereabouts of another suspected accomplice remains unclear, France's national police chief said Friday.
Jean-Marc Falcone, speaking on France-Info radio, said he was unable to say if Salah Abdeslam, a friend of Abaaoud, could be back on French territory.
""We can't say anything about the exact geographic situation of that individual,"" he said.
European officials earlier acknowledged that French police stopped Abdeslam the morning after Friday's attacks at the Belgian border but then let him go. His brother Brahim was one of the Paris suicide bombers.
Authorities initially gave Abaaoud's age as 27, but on Thursday Paris prosecutors said he was 28. News of his death seemed to ease some tension in a country deeply shocked by the attacks.
""We now know that Abaaoud, the brain behind these attacks — one of the brains, because we must be particularly cautious, and we know what the threats are — was among the dead,"" Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the lower house of the French Parliament.
On Friday French President Francois Hollande's office said he will lead a national ceremony Nov. 27 honoring the victims of the deadliest attacks on France in decades. The ceremony will be held at the gold-domed Hotel des Invalides, where Napoleon's tomb lies and which is seen as a symbol of France's military and international strength.
Of the more than 350 people wounded in the attacks, scores are in critical condition, and medical authorities have warned that the death toll is likely to rise.
Under gray skies and rain, Paris on Friday marked a week since the bloodbath with silence and reflection.
Most demonstrations have been banned in the city since the attacks, but Parisians have been spontaneously gathering all week outside the restaurants, cafes and concert halls hit in the attacks to leave flowers, light candles or hold quiet vigils.
A demonstration planned Friday at France's oldest mosque to show inter-community solidarity after the attacks was canceled for security concerns.
Next week Hollande is going to Washington and Moscow to push for a stronger international coalition against IS. French military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron said Thursday that French forces have destroyed 35 Islamic State targets in Syria since the attacks on Paris.

"The Israeli Government Press Office said Ezra Schwartz from Sharon, Mass., died in the attack on Thursday. 
Schwartz, who was spending his gap year in Israel, was reportedly on his way to deliver food to Israeli soldiers when he was gunned down.
Schwartz studied in a Jewish seminary outside Jerusalem and had come to the country on Masa, a program that brings young Jews from abroad to live in the country, according to a statement distributed by the press office.
""Ezra came to Israel not only to study but also to be a part of the vibrant Israeli experience. This makes his death even more tragic,"" said Natan Sharansky, chairman of the Jewish Agency, which works closely with the government to promote Jewish immigration to Israel.

The shooting and a separate, earlier knife attack in Tel Aviv Thursday left at least five people dead, and two suspects – both identified as Palestinians -- were in custody, according to Israeli media reports.
The attacks took place a day after the 
 of five worshippers -- including three Americans -- inside a Jerusalem synagogue by two Palestinians armed with meat cleavers and a gun.
In the West Bank, at least three people were killed and three others were wounded after a Palestinian terrorist opened fire from his vehicle on cars stuck in a traffic jam in Gush Etzion, the Jerusalem Post reports. One of the other West Bank victims who died was an Israeli man in his 50s, a father of four according to local media.

Paramedics pronounced an 18-year-old American tourist dead at the scene, the Jerusalem Post reported. His identity was not immediately released. The Israeli man died after being taken to a hospital, and a third victim has been identified as a Palestinian bystander.
The other people injured in the shooting are being treated at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. Some of the wounded are Americans, Israeli media added.
“The murderous terror has struck Gush Etzion and Tel Aviv,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, according to Ynetnews. ""My heart is with the families of the murdered and I send my wishes for a speedy recovery to the wounded. Whoever condemned the attacks in France needs to condemn the attacks in Israel. It’s the same terror. Whoever does not do this is a hypocrite and blind.”
Nov. 19, 2015: The scene of a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.
Israeli media reported that one terrorist continued driving after shooting at a car, slamming into another vehicle. He then exited his vehicle and tried to fire more shots but was met with return fire from Israeli security forces and was taken into custody, according to the Jerusalem Post.
Earlier in the day, a Palestinian man was arrested after stabbing and killing two Israelis and wounding another who were engaged in mid-day prayers, Israeli media reported.
The attacker was arrested after being partially subdued by a civilian. Authorities identified him as Raed Khalil bin Mahmoud, a 36-year-old father of five from the West Bank city of Dura. He revealed to investigators that he works at a restaurant in Jaffa, 
.
The violence unfolded at the Panorama office building and shopping center in southern Tel Aviv. Authorities said the assault started at a shop where people were engaged in mid-day prayers.

"The suspected mastermind of last week's Paris massacre, and some of the other attackers, had exploited the Syrian refugee crisis to slip into France unnoticed, Prime Minister Manuel Valls revealed Friday, the same day the French Senate approved extending the nation's state of emergency by three months.
It also emerged that Abdelhamid Abaaoud may have even taken part in the attacks on the ground in Paris, as a French security official said a surveillance camera captured the alleged ringleader inside a nearby subway station as the massacre unfolded. Valls also said another person died from the attacks, bringing the total number of dead to 130.
A third body was found after Wednesday's apartment raid north of Paris that left Abaaoud and his cousin dead, the French prosecutor's office reported Friday. A police source told Agence France-Presse the cousin, Hasna Aitboulahcen, did not blow herself up, as was previously reported. The suicide bomber was a man, the source said.
Abaaoud was seen at the Croix de Chavaux metro station in the suburb of Montreuil at 10:14 p.m. on Nov. 13, the French security official told The Associated Press. The black Seat car used in the attacks was found abandoned near the subway station, investigators say.
Valls said some of the Paris attackers had taken advantage of the massive influx of migrants into Europe escaping war in the Middle East.
""These individuals took advantage of the refugee crisis... of the chaos, perhaps, for some of them to slip in"" to France, he told French TV. ""Others were in Belgium already. And others, I must remind you, were in France.""
Police now turn their attention to two other suspects who are believed to have participated in the attacks. Police have identified one of them as Salah Abdeslam, who grew up in the same Belgian district as Abaaoud, the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek.
There was no indication Abdeslam escaped to neighboring Spain or tried to do so, Spanish Interior Miniister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. He told Antena 3 television that security officials from several countries were called together in Paris to discuss the possibility that Abdeslam might try to cross into a country bordering France.
Spanish police say French authorities sent a bulletin to officers across Europe asking them to watch out for a Citroen Xsara car that could be carrying Abdeslam.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/20/france-pm-says-paris-attacks-ringleader-used-migrant-crisis-to-get-into-country/,"Paris massacre ringleader used migrant crisis to get into France, PM says"

As the grip of terror tightens on Europe, a blueprint for existing with an unrelenting threat lies to the east, where Israelis have become accustomed to metal detectors, armed guards, spot searches and long lines.
No nation has faced more security challenges in the face of unrelenting terrorism than Israel, and now the Jewish state's methods could light the way for Europe now that much of the continent finds itself awash in refugees and under threats from ISIS. But emulating Israel will not be cheap or convenient, and can never completely eliminate the risk of an attack -- anytime and anywhere. 
""Israel has the determination [to secure its citizens] but it is also a question of financial considerations, too,"" Efraim Inbar, professor of political studies at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, told FoxNews.com. ""They put a lot of money into the security services. We have guards checking shoppers, passengers. It's a big system. Some people might find it offensive in terms of living in a democracy, but this is what is needed.""
Rifle-toting guards at shopping malls and train stations, compulsory ID cards and a host of other highly visible security measures are all part of daily life in Israel. Not as readily apparent is a well-resourced internal and external intelligence community with tentacles everywhere. The extensive security apparatus comes at a significant cost in high taxes, but Israelis see it as the only alternative in the face of a daily threat from Islamic extremism, a threat with which the West is increasingly coming to grips.
""Some people might find it offensive in terms of living in a democracy, but this is what is needed.""
- Efraim Inbar, professor of political studies at Bar-Ilan University
""If the West continues to delude itself about the scale of the challenge, those who delight in the divine gift of life will find themselves becoming increasingly constrained and terrified by those who assert an imperative to kill and be killed in the name of God,"" David Horovitz noted in Sunday's Times of Israel.
Parisians are still reeling from Friday's coordinated attacks, which killed at least 129 and followed the Charlie Hebdo attack in January. With a wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring into European cities from the war-ravaged Middle East, international law enforcement experts fear ISIS may have planted terror cells among the desperate masses. The terror organization has already said it would do exactly that.
Israelis were also once reluctant to submit to searches and encounter metal detectors at malls and government buildings, but in the face of an unrelenting terror threat, such inconveniences have become part of life. (AP)
While Western nations and constitutional democracies value freedom and individual rights above all else, Israel learned the hard way that compromises must be made to keep people safe. The target of numerous radical Islamic militant organizations -- including ISIS and Hamas -- as well as states sponsoring terrorism, such as Iran, the Jewish state changed its mindset after suffering a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings during the late-1990s and early 2000s that cost many hundreds of lives – among them dozens of U.S. citizens – and maimed many more.
It is currently experiencing, but containing, a sustained wave of terror attacks emanating mainly from 
. There have been a series of cases in the past few weeks where terrorist attackers have been ""neutralized"" by members of the public, as well as those in which police, the army, or security services reacted fast to eliminate terrorists involved in random attempts to kill innocent citizens. The cost of defending Israel -- from both foreign and internal enemies -- is staggering. By the most modest estimates, Israel spends a whopping 5.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, some 50 percent more per capita than the U.S., 
.
Nations such as France, the United Kingdom and Germany typically spend 2 percent or less of GDP on defense, a number that could soar if Israeli-style measures are deemed necessary to guard against terror.
""I am not sure that Europe is ripe for it, and I am not sure they have the political determination to change,"" Inbar said. ""There is no foolproof system though, and Europeans (as well as Americans) have to learn to live with this [terror] phenomenon. Israel is not always successful in preventing terrorism. This is part of life in these times.""
Strict security and proportionately high expenditure on defense and internal security are things Israelis earnestly wish they could live without, but painful experience has meant having to change. Many in Europe and beyond still seem reluctant to make those changes, fearing the erosion of some civil liberties -- despite the heavy loss of life in Paris last weekend -- and the prospect, according to many experts, of more terrorist attacks to come on mainland Europe.
""I think the experience of our security services is very valuable and many do come and learn from us in terms of defending installations, including airports,"" Inbar said. ""The basic change however has to come in terms of the public atmosphere, what should be done about this, and this is something the Europeans have to do on their own.""",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/18/future-security-israeli-model-shows-high-cost-living-with-terror-threat/,Future of security: Israeli model shows high cost of living with terror threat

Police officials say the attack happened in the Nahiyet al-Rasheed neighborhood where a roadside bomb went off first on the street outside the mosque, just as worshippers were finishing Friday prayers. Within minutes, a suicide bomber inside the mosque detonated an explosives vest.
The officials say 28 people were also wounded in the attack. Two police officers are among the dead and four have been wounded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

"Two Islamic State-claimed attacks on Friday in Yemen's largest province killed at least 15 people and wounded 30, security officials said, in the latest sign the extremists are taking advantage of the country's civil war to expand their reach.
Meanwhile, a lawyer representing an American held in Yemen since 2010 on suspicion of being linked to Al Qaeda militants said his client wasn't among three U.S. citizens recently freed and evacuated from the country.
Friday's synchronized attacks targeted checkpoints manned by security forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognized government in the cities of Shibam and al-Qatn, both in Hadramawt province, officials said.
A car bomb detonated amid the fighting in Shibam, according to video shot by a local resident that corresponded to other Associated Press reporting about the assault.
The security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists, provided the casualty figures. A claim for the attack circulated online by Islamic State supporters offered a higher death toll of 50 killed. The discrepancy could not be immediately reconciled.
While the AP could not independently verify the Islamic State claim, it corresponded to others previously released by the group. ISIS has claimed a series of bombings that killed 152 and wounded 345 people this year in Yemen, according to an AP count.
Earlier in the day, officials blamed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen's local branch of the militant group, for the attacks. Al Qaeda fighters have captured much of Hadramawt province and its capital, Mukalla, amid the civil war gripping the country. Washington considers the branch to be the world's most dangerous.
Yemen's civil war pits Shiite rebels known as Houthis and their allies against the internationally backed government forces and a Saudi-led coalition. At least 5,700 people have been killed in the conflict in Yemen since March 26, including 830 women and children, the United Nations said Wednesday. The war has pushed the country to the brink of famine, as the U.N. says over 21 million people — 80 percent of the population — need humanitarian assistance.
Houthis and others have taken foreigners hostage in the chaos of the war. On Thursday, officials said three Americans held captive by the Houthis in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, had been freed and flown to neighboring Oman after the sultanate negotiated on Washington's behalf.
The U.S. Embassy in Muscat has not identified those freed. However, they did not include Sharif Mobley, a U.S. citizen held in Yemen since 2010 on suspicion of being part of Al Qaeda, said Cori Crider, an American lawyer representing him.
Mobley, who grew up in New Jersey, faces a death sentence on charges he killed a hospital guard while trying to escape government custody. He was apparently seized by the Houthis when they took Sanaa in September 2014.
Crider, who works with the United Kingdom-based advocacy group Reprieve, said in a statement that the U.S. State Department has yet to offer any new information to Mobley's family.
""Why is State refusing to help his distressed relatives?"" she asked. ""As his lawyer, I am dumbfounded at this wall of silence, and can only assume that the U.S. is embarrassed at its own role in his terrible ordeal.""",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/20/isis-claims-2-attacks-in-yemen-killing-at-least-15/,ISIS claims 2 attacks in Yemen killing at least 15
"Malaysia's leader on Saturday denounced the Islamic State as an ""evil"" terrorist group, saying his Muslim-majority country is ready to join others to defeat it. But he cautioned that a military solution alone was not enough, and what needs to be vanquished is the ideology.
President Barak Obama, who is also in Malaysia, spoke in the same vein, saying the world is determined ""to push back on the hateful ideologies that fuel this terrorism.""
""We will not allow these killers to have a safe haven,"" Obama said at a business conference on the sidelines of a summit of Southeast Asian leaders that Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak addressed earlier. The two leaders will attend a larger summit of 18 Asia-Pacific countries on Sunday.
Najib said the world is in dire need of moderation. ""This is how Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King won the hearts and minds of their enemies. They won by transforming their foes into friends,"" he said.
The summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, followed by a series of nine other regional meetings, is taking place in Malaysia's main city in the backdrop of several extremist attacks around the globe, some of which were claimed by the Islamic State group.
The attacks included the bombings and assaults in Paris and Beirut, the bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt, and the hostage taking in Bamako, Mali, on Friday. Closer to home, a Malaysian hostage was killed by an Islamic militant group in the southern Philippines.
""The perpetrators ... do not represent any race, religion or creed. They are terrorists and should be confronted as such, with the full force of the law,"" Najib said in a stirring speech that repeatedly emphasized the tolerance of Islam.
""Malaysia stands ready to provide any help and support that we can, and be assured that we stand with you against this new evil that blasphemes against the name of Islam,"" he said.
Besides Malaysia, the region also includes Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation that is no stranger to extremism. But by and large, Southeast Asia has not been inflicted by the kind of violence seen in the Middle East, where the Islamic State is most potent.
Najib suggested that economic growth has been the bedrock of the region's relative peace and progress. The combined GDP of the 10 nations — a motley conglomeration of 630 million people following Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Confucianism and Taoism — was $2.6 trillion in 2014, an 80 percent increase in seven years.
The region is aiming for greater economic, political and cultural integration. On Sunday, ASEAN — as the grouping is known — will formally establish the ASEAN Community to create a unified economic entity.
Envisaged in 2002, work on the community began in 2007, and it's already delivering benefits to the region. Najib listed them in his speech:
 — Tariffs on trade in the region have been reduced to zero, or near zero, helping bring down prices of goods;
 — Unemployment is down to 3.3 percent;
 — Citizens enjoy visa-free travel through nine out of 10 countries;
 — Citizens are allowed to work in other countries in the region in eight major sectors, including tourism.
Despite the good news that Najib delivered, the community falls short in more politically sensitive areas such as opening up agriculture, steel, auto production and other protected sectors. Intra-regional trade has remained at around 24 percent of ASEAN's total global trade for the last decade, far lower than 60 percent in the European Union.
There are also other hurdles, such as corruption, uneven infrastructure and unequal costs of transportation and shipping. A wide economic gulf divides Southeast Asia's rich and middle income economies — Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines — and its four less developed members, Communist Vietnam and Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
Tan See Seng, a professor of international relations at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it is true that there are no tariffs at the borders. ""But once you enter ... you may have to grease the palms of some people in certain ASEAN countries to proceed. These 'behind the border' barriers ... are a key impediment slowing down the process of integration,"" he said.
Malaysian Trade Minister Mustapa Mohamad agreed that non-tariff barriers remain. ""There is a need for courage and political will. Sometimes we chickened out for whatever reason. It's important for us to push forward, to run faster,"" Mustapa told a regional business conference on Friday.
The AEC was envisaged to face competition from China and India for market share and investments. While China's economic growth is expected to slow to an average of 6 percent annually over the next five years, India's expansion is likely to pick up to 7.3 percent in the same period, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
ASEAN's relationship with China is highly complex and ambivalent. Despite being a competitor, China has also played the role of a principal financier in helping ASEAN reach its goals to temper its image as an economic threat.
At the same time, it has not hesitated to bully ASEAN countries in staking its claim to most of the South China Sea, where the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brunei have competing claims. Diplomatic squabbles have frequently erupted over oil and gas exploration and fishing rights in the area. China has also irked ASEAN countries by creating artificial islands from reefs to bolster its claim.

"French police and prosecutors, friends and families, and journalists have unveiled details about the men accused of carrying out the attacks in Paris. Altogether, authorities say that three teams participated in the bloody assault. At least one suspected participant remains at large.
Here's what's known about the suspects:
SUSPECTED MASTERMIND
 — ABDELHAMID ABAAOUD, 28
French investigators identified Belgian-born Abaaoud of Moroccan descent as the architect of the Paris attacks. A U.S. official briefed on intelligence matters said Abaaoud was a key figure in an Islamic State external operations cell that U.S. intelligence agencies have been tracking for months.
Officials initially believed he had coordinated the assaults against a soccer stadium, cafes and a rock concert from Syria, but he died during a police raid Wednesday on a Paris apartment that was a 15-minute walk from the Stade de France.
Abaaoud was also suspected of involvement in several thwarted attacks this year, including on a church in the Parisian suburb of Villejuif, and possibly an attempted attack on a high-speed train when three Americans tackled a heavily armed man.
Abaaoud is believed to have gotten to know some of the attackers responsible for the Paris massacre in the Moleenbeek neighborhood of Brussels where he grew up.
How and when Abaaoud entered France before his death remained unclear. He had bragged in the Islamic State group's English-language magazine that he was able to slip in and out of Europe undetected.
Abaaoud was wanted in Belgium, where he was sentenced in absentia this year to 20 years' imprisonment for serving as an IS recruiter and kidnapping his younger brother, Younes. Belgian authorities say Abaaoud brought the boy, then 13, to Syria last year to join him in IS-controlled territory.
___
BATACLAN KILLERS
Three suicide bombers — two who blew themselves up and one shot by police — have been identified as targeting concert-goers at the Bataclan music venue:
 — ISMAEL OMAR MOSTEFAI, 29
Police say Mostefai blew himself up at the theater. Tall, quiet and conservatively dressed, Mostefai appears to have aroused little suspicion at the housing block he shared with his family in the French cathedral city of Chartres or at the nearby Anoussra Mosque. Arnauld Froissart, a 34-year-old bank employee who lives in the area, said Mostefai was ""very discreet"" and his family was ""very nice.""
French police believe Mostefai traveled to Syria in the past few years, although it's not clear what he did there.
At the Anoussra Mosque, Islamic association leader Ben Bammou confirmed that Mostefai was a regular mosque-goer until about two years ago. He said he saw no sign of fanaticism. ""He was a reserved young man who played soccer with his colleagues; he was a baker who was coming to pray daily,"" he told The Associated Press.
 — SAMY AMIMOUR, 28
The Frenchman was charged in a terrorism investigation in 2012. He had been placed under judicial supervision but dropped off the radar and was the subject of an international arrest warrant.
Amimour, who had a short career as a bus driver, had already run into trouble with the law. French officials quizzed him on Oct. 19, 2012, over links to a network of terror sympathizers and an abortive trip to Yemen.
Amimour's father traveled to Islamic State-held territory in June 2014 in an effort to convince his son to leave Syria but was rebuffed, according to Le Monde newspaper. ""He was with another guy, who never left us alone,"" the father said.
 — A third theater attacker remains unidentified.
___
STADIUM KILLERS
Authorities say three suicide bombers were set to attack the Stade de France, though they were unable to get into the stadium and they killed only one bystander:
 — AHMAD AL-MOHAMMAD, 25
That's the name written on a Syrian passport found near one of the suicide bombers. The document describes Al-Mohammad as a 25-year-old from the rebel-held Syrian city Idlib. French officials said in a statement that the bomber's fingerprints match a set taken in Greece in October.
A Greek official says the person holding Al-Mohammad's passport went through administrative processing on the Greek island of Leros after setting out from Turkey, staying there for five days before arriving by ship in Athens. He later entered Serbia, where authorities took fingerprints that match those given in Greece, and he then crossed into Croatia the next day, according to a Serbian security official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.
It's not known whether Al-Mohammad is the man's real name.
 — BILAL HADFI, age unclear.
A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly identified Hadfi, a French citizen, as one of the three stadium bombers. Belgian police said Friday they were keeping in custody a person linked to Hadfi in an investigation not directly related to the Paris attacks.
An official in the Belgian federal prosecutor's office said raids related to Hadfi targeted people in his ""entourage.""
 — The third stadium bomber hasn't been named, but French officials said Friday he entered Greece at the same time as Al-Mohammed.
___
CAFE ATTACKER
Authorities believe there was one attacker on the cafe Comptoir Voltaire:
 — BRAHIM ABDESLAM, 30 or 31
Abdeslam, elder brother of fugitive Salah Abdeslam, blew himself up outside the cafe.
A person in Belgium familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that Brahim Abdeslam became ""close"" with Abaaoud while living in the Molenbeek neighborhood.
____
FEMALE ACCOMPLICE
 — HASNA AITBOULAHCEN, 26
Authorities say Aitboulahcen died in the police raid on the apartment where Abaaoud was holed up.
On Friday, prosecutors said she didn't kill herself by detonating a suicide vest as previously thought.
She had lived a secular life, drinking alcohol and rarely visiting a mosque. The lawyer for Abaaoud's father said Friday that Aitboulahcen was his niece, and therefore Abaaoud's cousin.
Born in the Paris suburb of Clichy-la-Garenne, Aitboulahcen moved to the eastern French town of Creutzwald with her parents and four siblings when she was 16. Some years later Aitboulahcen apparently left Creutzwald and settled in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. Her father, who was born in Marrakech, and her older sister moved to Morocco.
Aitboulahcen is listed on company registration documents two years ago as manager of a construction company based in the Paris suburb of Epinay-sur-Seine that went bankrupt less than 10 months later.
Because her name came up in a drug-trafficking case, Aitboulahcen was under surveillance, and her movements may have led authorities to the Saint-Denis flat.
She, Abaaoud and one other as-yet-identified person were killed in the apartment raid. Authorities are investigating whether she had a role in the Paris attacks.
___
ON THE LOOSE
 — SALAH ABDESLAM, 26
Abdeslam, a Brussels-born man, is the brother of Brahim, who blew himself up outside the cafe Comptoir Voltaire.
Salah Abdeslam is sought as a suspected accomplice in the attacks and is described by French police as highly dangerous. He is the suspected driver of a group of gunmen during the attacks. Authorities identified him as the renter of a Volkswagen Polo that carried hostage-takers to the Paris theater.
Officials said Abdeslam entered Austria from Germany Nov. 9 with two unidentified companions and they were stopped for a routine traffic check. They said they were planning a vacation in Vienna.
The Abdeslam brothers booked a hotel in the southeastern Paris suburb of Alfortville and rented a house in the northeastern suburb of Bobigny several days before the attacks.
Hours after he was linked to the attacks, Abdeslam and two travelers were stopped in their car near the Belgian border. Four French officials acknowledged that police had Abdeslam in their grasp, but officials let him go after checking his ID.
Two men arrested in Belgium admitted driving to France to pick up Salah Abdeslam the morning after the attacks: Mohammed Amri, 27, and Hamza Attou, 21, are being held on charges of terrorist murder and conspiracy.
Salah's other brother, Mohamed Abdeslam, said all three siblings grew up in Belgium and seemingly were content with life in the West. ""We are an open-minded family. We never had any problem with justice,"" he said.

"It was like the end of the world, Anayatullah Nazari said. ""It was like they were determined to kill us all and that nobody would survive. It was like doomsday, nothing I could ever imagine.""
More than six weeks after a U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunship repeatedly struck a well-marked Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing 30 people in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, official U.S., NATO and Afghan government reviews have yet to be released.
But a dozen survivors interviewed by The Associated Press are convinced that the assault on the hospital — which treated wounded Taliban and government fighters alike — was no accident. They say it was sustained and focused on destroying the main hospital building, which the aid agency says ""correlates exactly"" with GPS coordinates it had given to all parties in the conflict.
A NATO general blamed human and technical errors for the attack. The Pentagon insists that the Americans involved in ordering the strike didn't realize it was a hospital.
If they did, it would be a war crime.
It was just after 2 a.m. on Oct. 3 when the AC-130 shattered the first quiet evening in almost a week in Kunduz, where U.S. and Afghan forces were locked in a ground battle to retake the city of 300,000 from the Taliban. Suddenly, heavy weapons fire rained onto the hospital. The plane flew overhead again and again, strafing people who tried to escape until 3:15 a.m.
There were 105 patients, 140 Afghan staffers and nine international staff inside, along with dozens of people caring for friends and relatives, as is the Afghan custom.
When it was finally over, some had been decapitated. Some bled to death after having limbs shot off. Some were burned beyond recognition. Two patients died on operating tables. Others died because medicine and blood supplies were destroyed. Those too ill to move were incinerated in their beds.
""One of my colleagues was trying to run away from the plane that kept coming back over the hospital,"" said a nurse who had gone outside to get some fresh air when the attack began.
""He ran from building to building but the plane was following him. Two other colleagues, Khalid and Tahseel, were also followed by the plane. Tahseel was hit by the guns fired from the plane and died. Khalid was injured,"" the nurse said, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own security.
Acting Afghan Defense Minister Masoom Stanekzai insists that the Taliban and Pakistan's spy agency directed their takeover of the city from the hospital. National security adviser Hanif Atmar told a European diplomat that the Afghans ""will take full responsibility,"" and that ""there was no doubt whatsoever that the Taliban were inside the hospital, that they took it over, thus violating its sanctity,"" according to notes from the meeting reviewed by the AP.
Doctors Without Borders — also known by its French acronym MSF — rejects these assertions, and no evidence has emerged to support them. Survivors interviewed by the AP said the compound was peaceful before the attack, and that MSF's no-guns policy was honored.
President Barack Obama has apologized to the MSF, without explaining why the U.S. military's chain of command approved the attack.
The AP has previously reported that U.S. special forces had described the hospital as being under enemy control. A senior officer in the Green Beret unit sent a report the day before, saying one of their objectives would be to ""clear the trauma center"" of enemy forces, and that its coordinates had been shared with ""all friendly forces,"" according to two people who described the officer's log to the AP.
According to one account, when about 35 Army Green Berets later came under heavy fire about a half-mile (one kilometer) from the hospital, they called for air strikes to take out Taliban ""command and control centers"" around the city, relaying targets provided by their Afghan allies, a former intelligence official said.
The special forces were in separate teams by then, and members involved in calling in the air strike have told investigators they were not aware the coordinates were for a hospital compound, according to an American official familiar with their account. These sources and the former intelligence officer spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to be quoted by name.
Neither Afghan nor U.S. ground forces had eyes on the target, American and Afghan officials said, although the gunship crew, flying in low and slow, would have seen it clearly lit up by generator-powered floodlights in the darkened city.
This sequence of events raises unresolved questions, including how the U.S. chain of command could miss that they were firing at a hospital. Some U.S. officials point to a military intelligence computer network that soldiers say was not working properly in Afghanistan at the time, raising the possibility that even though many special operations analysts knew of the hospital, the information was not made available to the commanders who approved the strike.
The doctors and nurses were exhausted that night, having treated 376 patients in the emergency room in the six days since the Taliban stormed the city of 300,000. Most were civilians, but three or four wounded government combatants and about 20 wounded Taliban also were being cared for, according to MSF's internal review, released Nov. 5.
""Everyone felt like we were in the safest place in Kunduz,"" said Nazari, who had been at the hospital for four days caring for his brother Obaidullah, who had been wounded by crossfire. He hadn't slept for three nights, so joined other caregivers trying to rest in a safe room.
""I must have slept around five minutes before I was woken up by the smoke and the dust coming into the basement. We were sure no one could survive what was happening above us,"" he said.
The nurse who asked not to be identified had just left the main building when he heard the first huge explosion and saw the intensive care unit ablaze. Then he went outside and was hit by a bullet.
""After about 20 minutes of the attack going on, the plane began dropping something that was bright and burning onto the hospital. I don't know what it was, but when it hit the ground it immediately burned and flared, but with no sound,"" the nurse said.
MSF says the intensive care unit, emergency room, operating theaters and outpatient department, as well as X-ray, laboratory, physiotherapy, mental health and sterilization areas ""all were destroyed in this wave after wave of strikes.""
MSF staff frantically called and texted U.S. military contacts in Washington, NATO's mission in Kabul and the U.N.'s civilian-military liaison office for humanitarian affairs in Kabul to call it off, but the Americans kept firing for more than an hour, survivors said.
A hospital security guard who also asked not to be named, for the sake of his own security, said he entered the still-smoldering remains of the intensive care unit and found that ""only one person was alive — injured but alive.""
""The rest were all dead. Doctors and patients were just burned. And while we were taking stock of the injured, four doctors died in the meeting room. A couple of the foreign doctors jumped out of the windows to escape the attack — it's a miracle they survived,"" the guard said.
Anayatullah Hamdard, an agriculture professor at Kunduz University, recovered the body of his father, Dr. Abdul Sattar. ""He was completely burned. I couldn't even see his face,"" Hamdard said.

"The family homes of the suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks and one of the suicide bombers stand only a few blocks apart in the Belgian capital's Molenbeek neighborhood. After a string of attacks in recent years linked to its grimy streets in central Brussels, a key question arises: Why Belgium?
The tiny nation renowned for beer, chocolates and the comic book hero Tintin is now suddenly infamous for Islamic extremism — and the easy availability of illegal weapons.
Belgium has a central location in Europe; few border controls; a common language with prime jihadist target France; and a political divide between French and Dutch speakers that has long created bureaucratic disarray in justice and security.
From the prime minister down, there is widespread acknowledgment of a complicated and disjointed national structure that hampers the fight against extremism. ""We have to do more and we have to do better,"" Prime Minister Charles Michel told legislators on Thursday, as he announced a slew of fresh measures to fight Islamic extremism.
For years, there have been calls for more funds to boost the ranks of judges and police, but progress has been slow as rival political camps bickered and austerity measures set in. Meanwhile, the splintering of municipal authority in Brussels and judicial authority nationwide means there's little sense of who's in charge of what in security matters.
Add to that a system in which policemen are often blocked from crossing borders — lacking jurisdiction to work in neighboring countries — while criminals can take advantage of Europe's open border policy, and it becomes clear why Belgium is attractive for terrorists.
""They do shop around for locations where it's easier to be unnoticed, or that your opponents will lose your trail,"" said Edwin Bakker, director of the Centre for Terrorism and Counterterrorism at Leiden University.
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian who was the presumed organizer of the attacks, was killed in a raid Wednesday outside of Paris. Belgium and France are still on a manhunt for Frenchman Salah Abdeslam, a longtime Brussels resident. Both men grew up in the hardscrabble Molenbeek district, and their family homes stand within a short walk of its main police station. Abdeslam's brother, Brahim, blew himself up in a suicide attack, while another Brussels resident, Bilal Hafdi, also died in a suicide bombing.
Perched over Brussels stands the massive Palace of Justice, once a shining monument to democratic values, now cloaked for decades in scaffolding so decrepit it has come to symbolize Belgium's neglect for law and order. From there, one can look out onto the Midi, a grimy neighborhood that has become a treasure trove for any criminal looking for illegal arms.
Until 2006, Belgium had a very permissive gun law by European standards, and many weapons used in the 1990s Balkan wars easily found their way into the Belgian criminal underworld. At the same time, the Justice Ministry was hurt by austerity measures, rendering it powerless to dig into the root causes of the problem.
""It is relatively easy to get your hands on heavy arms in Brussels,"" said Brice De Ruyver, a professor of criminology at Ghent University, who was security adviser to the prime minister from 2000 to 2008. ""That applies to terror and serious crime. That is because the illegal arms trade has been neglected far too long. ... And once you have a reputation, it is tough to get rid of it.""
Molenbeek is separated from Midi by part of a mosaic of jurisdictions of 19 municipalities and 6 policing zones — all for a population of 1 million — which has long hampered cooperation. In comparison, New York, with five boroughs for 8.4 million people, has one police force.
Often municipalities were socialist or liberal fiefdoms with little interest in being swallowed up by a centralized Brussels administration. The number of police zones has been reduced from 19, but the current six is still considered an anachronism given the need to unify forces in combating extremism.
""Talent and manpower are badly spread out over the zone,"" said De Ruyver. ""It is not where we need it most, namely in Molenbeek.""
Extremist ideology has also been allowed to thrive due to police neglect. For years, the leader of Islamic radical group Sharia4Belgium directed one of Europe's more potent recruitment machines for fighters in Syria. Yet it was only this year that he was sentenced to 12 years in prison as the leader of what a court determined was a terror group. ""Sharia4Belgium has been able to act with impunity for too long,"" said De Ruyver.
Prime Minister Michel has promised to crack down on radical mosque financing and clandestine places of worship, which have thrived largely because of Belgium's failures in integrating its 650,000-strong Muslim population.
""There is a part of the population that lives in the margins, that doesn't look to have contact,"" said Molenbeek mayor Francoise Schepmans. ""We let it happen.""
Many of the weaknesses have been linked to Belgium's complicated linguistic divide. Belgium's 6.5 million Dutch speakers in northern Flanders and the 4.5 million Francophones in southern Wallonia enjoy considerable political autonomy — seen as a way to help keep the country together. However, political appeasement between the groups has often trumped efficiency in decision-making.
""It's a nightmare,"" Bakker said of the language barriers within law-and-order institutions.

"The American who died in the attack at a Mali luxury hotel was identified late Friday as Anita Ashok Datar, the State Department said in a statement.
Datar, 41, was born in western Massachusetts and grew up in northern New Jersey. She graduated from Columbia University’s Joseph Mailman School of Public Health and School of International and Public Affairs with an MPH and MPA and served two years in the Peace Corps in Senegal.
She was also a founding member of Tulalens, a not-for-profit organization connecting underserved communities with quality health services, according to the State Department. Datar was described by her family as the most helpful person they knew.
She is survived by her son, brother and “many, many friends around the world.”
State Department spokesman John Kirby said the siege “concluded” after at least 27 people were killed when gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako and initially held 150 hostages. A security ministry spokesman told Reuters the remaining gunmen were still being flushed out on the upper floors of the building.
""They are alone with the Malian special forces who are trying to dislodge them,"" spokesman Amadou Sangho said. Al Qaeda-linked jihadists claimed responsibility for the siege.
A U.N. official told the Associated Press said 12 bodies were found in the basement and 15 bodies were found on the second floor. Another U.N. official, Mali mission spokesman Olivier Salgado, said two extremists have been killed and that forces were going from room to room, checking for more casualties.

At least one guest reported the attackers instructed him to recite verses from the Koran before he was allowed to leave the hotel, Malian army commander Modibo Nama Traore told The Associated Press.
At least five U.S. Defense Department personnel were among the Americans freed, according to a senior U.S. defense official, who told Fox News the 22 Defense Department and military personnel in Bamako at the time of the incident ""have all been accounted for.""
Traore said Malian special forces entered the hotel and freed hostages ""floor by floor."" Hours after the attacks began, local TV images showed heavily armed troops in what appeared to be a lobby area. Some U.S. military personnel in Bamako assisted in the rescue efforts, a defense official told Fox News.
Traore said 10 gunmen stormed the hotel Friday morning shouting ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" in Arabic before firing on the guards. A staffer at the hotel who gave his name as Tamba Diarra said over the phone that the attackers used grenades in the assault.
Al-Mourabitoun, a militant group based in northern Mali, said on Twitter that it was behind the attack, but the claim could not immediately be verified. The group is led by notorious one-eyed jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who gained recognition in 2013 for an attack on an Algerian gas plant that left 40 people dead, including three Americans.
American Anita Ashok Datar, 41, died in an attack at a Mali luxury hotel on Friday.
A handful of jihadi groups, some linked to Al Qaeda, seized the northern half of Mali -- a former French colony -- in 2012 and were ousted from cities and towns by a French military intervention.
The Brussels-based Rezidor Hotel group that operates the hotel said the assailants had initially ""locked in"" 140 guests and 30 employees.
The White House said President Obama was briefed about the attack by his national security adviser, Susan Rice. The U.S. Embassy in Mali told citizens to shelter in place amid reports of an ""ongoing active shooter operation.""
In August, the embassy had issued a message warning Americans of a ""heightened security risk to westerners in southern Mali, including the area outside Bamako city.""
The hotel raid Friday unfolded one week after the attacks on Paris that killed 130 people.
One witness, a Guinean singer, told Reuters that he heard the attackers speaking English. ""I heard them say in English ,'Did you load it?', 'Let's go',"" Sékouba Bambino Diabaté told the news agency after he was freed.
French President Francois Hollande said France was ready to help Mali with all means necessary in the wake of the attack and urged French citizens in Mali to make contact with the French Embassy there ""in order that everything is made to offer them protection.""
A top official at the French presidency told The Associated Press that French citizens were in the hotel but could not give more. The official spoke anonymously in line with presidency policy.
In Belgium, Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said there were four Belgians registered at the attacked hotel but it's unclear if they were taken hostage by the gunmen or not.
Five Turkish Airlines personnel were among the freed hostages, Turkey's state-run news agency said.
The website of the official China Daily newspaper also cited an unidentified witness as saying one Chinese citizen had been rescued.
Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has cut short its trip to Chad where he was attending a meeting of G5 Sahel.
The Mali presidency said on Twitter that Keita will be back to Bamako ""in the next hours.""
Meanwhile, France's national gendarme service says about 50 elite police troops were en route from Paris to Bamako.
A spokesman for the service who was not authorized to be publicly named said they are heading Friday from two different units of special police forces trained for emergency situations.
Even after the French-led military intervention in early 2013 that drove extremists from northern towns and cities in Mali, the northern part of the country remains insecure and militant attacks have extended farther south this year, including the capital. In March, masked gunmen shot up a restaurant in Bamako that is popular with foreigners, killing five people.
About 1,000 French troops remain in the country. The Netherlands also has troops working with the UN mission in Mali. According to the Dutch defense ministry, some 450 Dutch military personnel are taking part in the mission along with four Apache and three Chinook helicopters. Most of the Dutch force is based in Gao, but there are a few officers at the U.N. mission headquarters in Bamako.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/21/american-victim-in-mali-hotel-attack-identified/,American victim in Mali hotel attack identified
"Riding the Paris Metro to the city's Grand Mosque for prayers, Samia Mahfoudia says people shoot sideways looks at her ""almost as if they were saying 'Get off.'""
Ahmed El Mziouzi, a Moroccan who has called France home for 42 years, says he's seen people staring at Muslims like him ""a bit bizarrely"" since attackers claiming to be acting in the name of Islam massacred 130 people, traumatizing the city.
These are tough times for France's Muslims. Muslims were among both the dead and the hundreds of wounded in the Paris attacks. Muslims across Paris and the world also reacted with shock, horror and anger at the indiscriminate slaughter. In the French capital, Muslims have visited the makeshift shrines of flowers and candles outside the Bataclan concert hall and the cafes where the attackers mowed down victims in cold blood.
And all Parisians of every religion are having to adjust to a whole new post-attacks atmosphere of heightened angst and suspicion.
Armed police in thick bulletproof vests cordoned off roads around the Grand Mosque in Paris for Friday prayers and patted down worshippers, scanning them with metal detectors in the cold, driving rain. Soldiers wearing camouflage gear and cradling automatic rifles also patrolled.
But unlike other French, some Muslims also feel the additional burden of having to justify and defend themselves and their community and point out their Islam bears no relation to that of the violent zealots. They worry that some non-Muslims can't see the difference between them and Islamic State killers.
Cold, hard stares and, in rare cases, physical assaults that some Muslims have faced since the bloodshed are reinforcing concerns that some in France are now lumping all Muslims together.
""Out on the streets, we're scared,"" Soraya Moumen, a Muslim woman in her twenties, said on her way to prayers at the Grand Mosque. ""We feel people are adding one and one to make three, thinking that all Muslims are terrorists.""
A Muslim group that tracks Islamophobia in France has reported a fresh spike of hate crimes since the attacks, although not as large as that which followed the slaughter in January of cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo magazine and shoppers at a kosher grocery in Paris that left 17 victims dead.
The southern port city of Marseille saw both anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic violence after the latest attacks, with a veiled woman punched and slashed with a box cutter as she left the subway and a teacher at a Jewish school assaulted by three knife-wielding attackers, the Interior Ministry said.
Attacks have also been reported on Muslim meeting places and shops elsewhere in France.
Since France has the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in western Europe, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim violence are not new in the country. And some Muslims say they understand that the latest killing spree claimed by the Islamic State group has made some of their fellow citizens wary. Still, that doesn't make their cold shoulders easier to bear.
""I understand their pain. The anger,"" said Mahfoudia, a 64-year-old grandmother. ""(But) it's not because I wear a headscarf that I'm going to hurt other people.""
Muslim reaction to the latest massacre has been more clear-cut than after the January extremist attacks in Paris. Although the Muslim majority was repulsed by that violence, some also felt that Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists had insulted them and their faith and deliberately courted trouble with their satirical drawings poking fun at the Prophet Muhammad. For those reasons, some Muslims couldn't get behind the ""Je Suis Charlie (I am Charlie)"" rallying cry that caught fire worldwide.
""With Charlie, we weren't for a massacre, but it is true that we weren't too sorry,"" said Kader Benamou, who was browsing at an Islamic bookshop opposite the Grand Mosque.
The mathematics graduate who is now looking for work said he, too, has felt a frostier reception in the city he grew up in.
""Looks now are cold and wary. ... I can understand their paranoia a bit,"" he said.
But this time, Muslim opposition to the bloodshed appears more universal. The January gunmen specifically targeted journalists and Jews. The latest killers didn't care who they mowed down or what their victims believed. That made them terrifying for everyone.
""It is different, because this time there wasn't a gram of reason to it,"" said Benamou. ""They killed everything without knowing who their victims were. Just anybody. Just like that, wantonly, with no reason. So of course we're against that, 100 percent against, even 200 percent.""",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/20/paris-muslims-face-hostility-after-attacks-but-also-throw-their-weight-against/,Paris Muslims face hostility after attacks but also throw their weight against terror
"Dobrynya, police puppy. (Russian Interior Ministry)
A Russian puppy has big paws to fill.
Russia has sent the puppy to France in tribute to the French police dog Diesel who was killed in an anti-terrorism raid after the Paris attacks, Sky News reported Saturday.
Diesel’s death prompted an outpouring of grief and Russia hopes the puppy named Dobrynya fills the void.
The Russian minister for internal affairs Vladimir Kolokoltsez wrote to his French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve, offering the young canine as “confirmation of our solidarity with the French police in these troubled days,” according to Sky News.
Diesel was killed when police stormed an apartment in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday. ISIS terrorist Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, the mastermind of the Paris attacks that killed 130 and injured hundreds more was killed in the raid, officials said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi says ""winds of change"" are blowing through India's economy, after further market liberalization to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub.
Modi said Saturday that India's economy has improved since his government took office 18 months ago and implemented two rounds of structural and financial reforms.
He said the government is working to ensure a transparent and predictable tax regime, protect intellectual property rights through a new national policy due out soon and remove bottlenecks to make India the easiest place to do business.
However, he said reforms are ""just a way station"" on the long journey to transform India.
Modi told a business conference on the sidelines of a Southeast Asia summit: ""We must reform to transform. ASEAN economies have done their bit for Asia's resurgence. Now, it is India's turn. And we know that our time has come. We are at a take-off stage. I invite you to come and see the winds of change in India.""

Southeast Asian nations have proposed creating a regional convention that would provide the legal framework to prevent human trafficking, especially women and children.
The leaders of 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations made the commitment during their summit Saturday. In urging their ministers to work on the regional law, the leaders said that ""victims of trafficking, mainly vulnerable women and children, have a fundamental right to be protected"" in line with international laws.
The issue was highlighted earlier this year when hundreds of Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority of Myanmar, were found to have been trafficked through Thailand to Malaysia.
The leaders did not name the Rohingya problem specifically in their statement announcing the intention to create the ASEAN convention against trafficking to be known by its acronym ACTIP.

Some 100 Malaysian Muslim activists protested President Barack Obama's visit to the Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation, denouncing him as an enemy of Islam.
Obama arrived Friday for a three-day visit of regional meetings, his second trip here since April last year.
Muslim men wearing skull caps and women in colorful headscarves rallied Saturday near a Kuala Lumpur convention center, where Obama is due to meet Southeast Asian leaders later Saturday.
They chanted ""Reject Obama"" and held banners that read ""O Terrorist, you are not welcome here,"" and ""America's war of terrorism is a war against Islam.""

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says Japan is the ""best partner"" for Asia as it gears up for a new growth phase toward lasting sustainable growth.
He says Japan is committed to bolster its overseas development assistance, and along with Asian Development Bank will provide $110 billion infrastructure financing over the next five years.
Abe was speaking Saturday at a business conference on the sidelines of a Southeast Asia summit.
He says Asia's growth is about to transition to a new stage, which is a challenge in ensuring lasting growth.
He added: ""We do not impose our culture on others ... we think together and move together with the local people.""
For example, he said the recipe for Japanese ramen noodle has been modified in Malaysia by using chicken broth and meat, instead of pork, which is prohibited in Islam.

President Barack Obama says the deadly assault on a hotel in Mali is yet another reminder that the ""scourge of terrorism"" threatens many nations.
And he says the ""barbarity"" shown by Islamic extremists at the Radisson hotel in the capital of Bamako ""only stiffens our resolve to meet this challenge.""
The assault on the hotel came exactly one week after attacks coordinated by the Islamic State group left 130 people dead across Paris.
At least 20 were killed in Mali, including at least one American.
Obama says the U.S. is working to account for Americans who may have been at the hotel. He also extended condolences to families of the victims, and thanked the security forces who responded.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has opened a two-day regional summit with a call to defeat Islamic terrorism, saying its barbaric attacks do not represent any race or religion.
Najib was speaking Saturday at the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional grouping of 10 nations that include the Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Indonesia, and the neighboring Philippines, which has a large Muslim minority, have been hit by Islamic extremism.
Najib referred to those two countries, as well as the attacks in Paris and Friday's deadly hostage-taking in Bamako, Mali.
Najib says Malaysia stands ready to provide any help and support it can.
He says: ""Be assured that we stand with you against this new evil that blasphemes against the name of Islam.""

After a meeting with Obama late Friday, Najib said his government is very clear that it is against the IS, ""its ideology, what it stands for.""
He says ""it is evil. It is against Islam. It is a perverted Islam. And they do not represent us.""

Obama is in Malaysia to attend a regional summit that ends Sunday.
In his remarks, Obama said Malaysia, like Indonesia, is a majority-Muslim country that represents tolerance and peace. Obama said that as a consequence, ""its voice is critical in the debate that is taking place internationally around terrorism.""

Heads of state from 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have formally opened their weekend summit in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
The main event is the launch of a unified economic community that has been eight years in the making.
On Sunday, the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines, along with ASEAN's four less developed members, Communist Vietnam and Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, will sign a declaration establishing the ASEAN Economic Community, originally envisioned in 2002.
Although ASEAN has helped greatly increase the region's economic and political integration, there is a long way to go before the AEC becomes fully functional after becoming a legal entity on Dec. 31.
ASEAN countries have torn down tariff barriers and have removed some visa restrictions, but they fall short in more politically sensitive areas such as opening up agriculture, steel, auto production and other protected sectors.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/21/latest-indian-prime-minister-modi-says-winds-change-blowing-through-india/,The Latest: Indian Prime Minister Modi says 'winds of change' blowing through India's economy
